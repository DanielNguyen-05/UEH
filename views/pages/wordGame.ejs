            <h3>Description:</h3>
            <p>This place contains an important message about the tradition of learning and respecting teachers, but the Chinese characters and Nom characters are blurred or misaligned. You need to decode them to restore the original message.</p>
            
            <h3>Mechanism:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Word puzzle: Players will be provided with scrambled or missing Chinese characters/Nom characters and need to rearrange or fill in the blanks to form a meaningful sentence.</li>
                <li>Find the rule: Characters can be encoded according to a certain rule (e.g. replace with numbers, reverse order). Players need to find the rule to decode the entire stele.</li>
                <li>Compare and contrast: Compare the erroneous stele passages with translations or reference materials (in the game) to find the correct character.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Reward:</h3>
            <p>Gain a better understanding of the cultural value of the Temple of Literature, receive academic items (e.g., inkstones, ancient books), and experience points.</p>
